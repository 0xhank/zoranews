# Monorepo Structure and Architecture

## Package Organization
- Root workspace manages all packages via pnpm workspaces
- Client package (`packages/client`) contains the React frontend
- Server package (`packages/server`) contains the tRPC server
- Shared package (`packages/shared`) contains shared types and utilities

## Dependency Management
- Use workspace references (`workspace:*`) for internal dependencies
- Keep package versions consistent across all packages
- Use `pnpm` for package management and workspace commands
- Root package.json contains scripts for running all packages

## Naming Conventions
- Package names use the format `@zora-news/[package-name]`
- Use consistent naming across the codebase
- Folders should be kebab-case, files should be camelCase
- React components should be PascalCase

## Type Sharing
- Define shared types in the `shared` package
- Export all types through the package entry point
- Import shared types in both client and server packages
- Ensure type consistency between client and server
