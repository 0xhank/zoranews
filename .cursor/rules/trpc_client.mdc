# tRPC Client Integration

## Client Setup
- tRPC client is configured in `src/utils/trpc.ts`
- Client uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Main provider is set up in the app's entry point
- Connects to the tRPC server at http://localhost:3069/trpc

## Custom Hooks
- Each domain has its own custom hook (`useNews.ts`, `useMemecoin.ts`, etc.)
- Hooks encapsulate tRPC procedures and provide a clean interface
- Components should use these hooks instead of direct tRPC calls
- Hooks handle data fetching, caching, and error states

## Usage in Components
- Import the appropriate hook for the domain you're working with
- Use destructuring to access the data and utility functions
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Pass the correct parameters to query and mutation functions

## Type Safety
- Types are automatically inferred from the server's router
- The AppRouter type is imported from the server package
- Client code has full type safety with server endpoints
- No need for manual type definitions for API responses
