# Server Environment Configuration

## Environment Variables
- Set `BASE_RPC_URL` to specify the Base chain RPC URL (defaults to "https://mainnet.base.org")
- Set `PRIVATE_KEY` as a secure Ethereum private key for server-side transactions (required)
- Store sensitive variables in a `.env` file which is .gitignored
- Variables are loaded using dotenv in the server entry point
- Use proper secret management in production environments

## Security Considerations
- Never commit private keys or sensitive API keys to the repository
- Validate all environment variables before usage to prevent runtime errors
- Consider using environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production)
- Rotate private keys periodically and implement proper access controls
- Use env-encryption tools for production deployment secrets

## Local Development
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the server package root
- Generate a test-only private key for local development
- Ensure proper fallbacks for non-critical environment variables
- Add validation checks for required variables on server startup
- Use `process.env.VAR_NAME` to access variables in your code
