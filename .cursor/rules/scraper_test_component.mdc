# ScraperTest Component Rules

## Coin Creation
- Use the `useZoraCoins` hook for coin creation functionality.
- Specifically, use the `createCoinFromNews` mutation.
- This mutation requires `articleId` and `symbol`.
- The `payoutRecipient` is optional; if not provided by the client, the server defaults to its own address.
- The component automatically generates a `symbol` based on the article headline.
- The client does not need to provide a `payoutRecipient` address.
- Display status messages for success and error states using `creationStatus` state.
- Reset the `selectedArticleId` after successful creation.

## UI Elements
- The component should not contain any input fields for coin creation.
- The button to trigger creation should be labeled "Create Coin from Article".
- The button should be disabled using the `isCreatingFromNews` loading state.

## Data Handling
- Fetch news articles using the `useNewsScraper` hook.
- Allow users to select an article from the list.
- Use the `selectedArticle` state to track the chosen article.
- Pass the `selectedArticle.id` and generated `symbol` to the `createCoinFromNews` mutation.
