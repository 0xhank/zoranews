# AI Content Generation

## OpenAI Service (`openaiService.ts`)

- System prompts should clearly define the AI's role, desired output format (e.g., JSON), and provide specific examples where helpful.
- Input validation should be performed on data passed to OpenAI functions.
- Output validation should be performed on the response received from OpenAI, especially when expecting structured data like JSON.
- Use appropriate OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `dall-e-3`) based on the task requirements and cost considerations.
- Handle potential errors from the OpenAI API gracefully (e.g., API key issues, generation failures, network errors).
- Manage API keys securely using environment variables (`.env`) and avoid committing them, following guidelines in `server_env.mdc`.
- Ensure prompts are designed to minimize ambiguity and guide the AI towards the desired output style and constraints (e.g., character limits).
