# Workflow Router

## Procedure: createCoinFromNews

- Orchestrates the end-to-end process: fetching news, selecting an article, and creating a Zora coin.
- This procedure is a `mutation` and takes no input parameters.
- It utilizes caller instances to invoke procedures from other routers:
    - Calls `newsRouter` (expects a procedure like `getLatestHeadline`) to retrieve the latest news article.
    - Calls `coinRouter` (expects a procedure like `createCoin`) to mint the Zora coin.
- Performs necessary data transformation to derive coin parameters (name, symbol, description, URI) from the fetched news article.
- Incorporates Zod schemas (`ArticleSchema`, `CoinSchema`, `CreateCoinInputSchema`) for validating data structures at various stages.
    - Note: These schemas within `workflow.ts` are placeholders and should mirror the actual schemas used by the called procedures in `newsRouter` and `coinRouter`.
- Outputs the details of the successfully created coin, conforming to the `CoinSchema`.
- Includes comprehensive logging and error handling using `TRPCError` for robust operation.
