# News Scraper Module

## Overview
- Primary module for collecting crypto news articles from various sources
- Located in `packages/server/src/services/newsScraper.ts`
- Returns normalized `NewsArticle` objects with consistent structure
- Focuses exclusively on RSS feeds for reliable, structured data

## Data Sources
- RSS feeds only: CoinDesk, Decrypt, BeInCrypto, The Block, Cointelegraph
- Processes feeds with fast-xml-parser for XML parsing
- No HTML scraping to avoid reliability issues and anti-scraping measures

## Content Filtering
- Time-based filtering: Only includes articles from the past 12 hours
- Content-based filtering: Excludes sponsored/advertorial content
- Keyword-based filtering: Rejects articles containing terms like "sponsored", "press release", etc.
- Category-based filtering: Skips articles in promotional or sponsored categories

## RSS Configuration
- Each RSS feed configured with XML path mappings
- `itemPath`: Path to article items in the XML structure
- `titlePath`: Path to headline content
- `descriptionPath`: Path to article summary
- `linkPath`: Path to article URL
- `datePath`: Path to publication date
- `categoryPath`: Optional path to article categories

## Extraction Logic
- Processes all RSS feeds with appropriate headers
- Handles dates to filter for recency
- Smart deduplication across multiple sources
- Groups similar articles to prevent duplicates
- Implements randomized request delays to avoid rate limiting
- Utilizes the native Node.js `crypto` module for generating unique IDs for articles

## Anti-Bot Measures
- Uses browser-like User-Agent headers to avoid being blocked
- Sets appropriate Accept headers for XML content
- Implements timeout handling for requests

## Deduplication Strategy
- Uses Jaccard similarity to identify related articles
- Groups similar articles based on headline content
- Selects best article from each group based on completeness
- May include multiple sources for major stories
- Tracks seen URLs to prevent duplicates during scraping session

## Testing
- Test script in `packages/server/src/test-scraper.ts`
- Validates scraper functionality without full server startup
- Logs sample articles for manual verification
